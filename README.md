This repository contains ongoing work to automate the following framework. The framework is presented in the paper titled "_A Framework for Consistent Co-Verification of Robotic Systems by Simulation and Proof_."

We describe our framework through examples. We increase the complexity of these examples to demonstrate various aspects of the framework. All examples can be found in the _Examples_ folder.
# Example: Simple Arm Serial Chain
This example is introduced in "_A Framework for Consistent Co-Verification of Robotic Systems by Simulation and Proof_." We use it to describe the main features of our technique algorithms, by presenting the outputs of each translation step.
